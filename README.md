### Discrete Mathematics project Famaf university 2019 
Project about graphs coloring, with format DIMACS but whith the correct numbers of sides an nodes passed by standard input of C. There is an implementation of greedy algorithm for coloring, "bipartito algorithm" and a lot of kinds to reordenate the
nodes for greedy.

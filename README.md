### Discrete Mathematics project Famaf university 2019 
Project about graphs coloring, with DIMACS format (whith the correct numbers of sides an nodes) passed by standard input of C (terminal or file). The repository has an implementation of greedy algorithm for coloring, "bipartito algorithm", a lot of ways to reordenate the nodes for greedy, a little "test main" and 2 test graphs in DIMACS format (file).
